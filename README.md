# Personal-Website

My personal website

### Overview of the project

My website contains four pages: the Home page, Resume page, Projects page, and Interests page. The home page is what is shown upon opening the website, and can also be reached by clicking the symbol resembling the favicon at the top left, while the other three pages can be found using the corresponding header buttons. There are also a total of six links, the first three being the remaining header buttons: GitHub, LinkedIn, and YouTube which links it to my personal accounts on those sites, and the last three are found at the bottom of the home page as a text hyperlink to SFU's computing science page, TransLink, and a random cat channel.

My home page contains a short bio of myself with a profile picture, as well as 3 images that resonates with me.

My resume page contains a scroll box with a pdf of my resume

My projects page showcases the projects I worked on, with a hyperlink to the corresponding GitHub repo's.

My interests page simply shows the 3 images that I have a great interest in, which are the same as the 3 home page bottom images. The images themselves are also buttons that links to SFU's computing science page, TransLink, and a random cat channel.

My personal website works best with a screen width of 1920 pixels.

### Reason for choosing license

The license I chose to use is Apache License 2.0, since it is often used for software products and development, especially on GitHub. This license gives users the permission to use my software for commercial use, to modify it, distribute it, use in patents, and for private use. However, it cannot be trademarked by a foreign user since they are not the original writers of the code, there is no warranty with the code, and I am not liable for any damage or harm caused by the code since any harm caused by it is out of my control. 

### Tech stack used

I used HTML and CSS. HTML is used for the majority of the website including all of the text, while CSS is used for styling the website, including the header, buttons, and images.
